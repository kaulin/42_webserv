> To anyone in general, but fellow 42 students in particular: when faced with a problem, it is always better to attempt solving it first alone without consulting the previous works of others. Your precursors were no smarter than and just as fallible as you; Blindly following their footsteps will only lead you on the same detours they took and prevent you from seeing new, faster routes along the way.
